# OBJECTIVE

1.  What is CSS?
2.  What are selectors?
3.  What is CSS Syntax?
4.  How do we select elements by class?
5.  How do we select elements by id?

# CSS DEFINED

1.  What is CSS?
    - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    - A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    - CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.

# CSS DEMO

    - Interact with the CSS Demo by switching stylesheets as indicated

# CSS SOLVED A BIG PROBLEM

1.  HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
2.  HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, for example:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

3.  CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

# CSS SYNTAX

![selector](./assets/css/selector.gif)

1.  The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
2.  The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
3.  Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
4.  A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

### EXAMPLE

In the following example all `<p>` elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:

```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```

# CSS SELECTORS

1.  In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
2.  CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more.

# THE ELEMENT SELECTOR

1.  The element selector selects elements based on the element name.
2.  You can select all `<p>` elements on a page like this (in this case, all `<p>` elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color):

```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```

# THE ID SELECTOR

1.  The **id selector** uses the **id attribute** of an HTML element to select a specific element.
2.  The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one **unique element**!
3.  To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
4.  The style rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1":

```css
#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

# THE CLASS SELECTOR

1.  The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
2.  To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
3.  In the example below, all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:

```css
.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

# THERE ARE 3 WAYS TO INCLUDE CSS INTO OUR WEB PAGES

# INLINE CSS

```html
<h1 style="color: red;">Mr. Bostwick</h1>

<body style="background-color: linen;">
  ...............
</body>

<p style="color: blue; border: 4px solid pink; background-color: purple;">
My Favorite Sports:
  <ol>
    <li>Basketball</li>
    <li>Football</li>
    <li>Flag Football</li>
  </ol>
</p>
```

# INTERNAL STYLESHEET

In between the `<head></head>` tags on our webpage, we nest `<style></style>` tags:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
  ..................
  ..................
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  ..................
  ..................
  ..................
  ..................
  ..................
</body>
</html>
```

# LINKING TO EXTERNAL STYLESHEETS

To link to an external stylesheet, we insert this:

```css
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
```

in between our `<head></head>` tags.

For Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>
  ..................
  ..................
  ..................
  ..................
  ..................
</body>
</html>
```
